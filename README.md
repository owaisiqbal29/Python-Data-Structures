# Python Data Structures

This repository contains my personal practice and learning journey in Python data structures. It includes examples, exercises, and notes that help reinforce core concepts and improve my coding skills.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to document my progress as I study and polish my understanding of Python's built-in data structures. I am focusing on writing clean, readable code and building a strong foundation for future projects and interviews.

## Topics Covered

- Lists: creation, indexing, slicing, appending, removing, sorting
- Tuples: immutability, unpacking, usage in functions
- Sets: uniqueness, set operations, membership testing
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs, updating, looping, nested dictionaries
- String manipulation and basic data types
- Logical operations and control flow using data structures

## Environment Setup

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Create a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create --name Python-Data-Structures python=3.13
   conda activate Python-Data-Structures
